## Welcome to baogegeJiang's Pages

My name is Jiang Yiran. And my nick name is baogege. So it's why the page named baogegeJiang.

I'm a master student in Peking Unversity majoring in geophysics. 

You can contact me var email: baogege@pku.edu.cn

I would like to share some research code there. Some of them have already been down. Most of them is on going.  

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/baogegeJiang/baogege.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
